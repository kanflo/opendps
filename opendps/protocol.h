/*
 *    *** Command types ***
 *
 * === Pinging DPS ===
 * The ping command is sent by the host to check if the DPS is online.
 *
 *  HOST:   [cmd_ping]
 *  DPS:    [cmd_response | cmd_ping] [1]
 *
 *
 * === Reading the status of the DPS ===
 * @todo this description is obsolete...
 *
 * This command retrieves V_in, V_out, I_out, I_limit, power enable. Voltage
 * and currents are all in the 'milli' range.
 *
 *  HOST:   [cmd_query]
 *  DPS:    [cmd_response | ccmd_query] [1] [V_in(15:8)] [V_in(7:0)] [V_out_setting(15:8)] [V_out_setting(7:0)] [V_out(15:8)] [V_out(7:0)] [I_out(15:8)] [I_out(7:0)] [I_limit(15:8)] [I_limit(7:0)] [<power enable>]
 *
 *
 * === Changing active function ===
 * Remember functions are the generic term for the functions your OpenDPS suports
 * (constant voltage, constant current, ...) and the cmd_set_function command
 * sets the active function. The change will be reflected on the display and
 * the current function will be turned off. The function name is sent in ascii
 * and must match a function of one of the registered screens.
 *
 *  HOST:   [cmd_set_function] [<function name>]
 *  DPS:    [cmd_response | cmd_set_function] [<status>]
 *
 * <status> will be 1 or 0 depending on if the function is available or not
 *
 *
 * === Listing available functions ===
 * This command is used to list the available functions on the OpenDPS.
 * <status> is always 1.
 *
 *  HOST:   [cmd_list_functions]
 *  DPS:    [cmd_response | cmd_list_functions]  [<status>] <func name 1> \0 <func name 2> \0 ...
 *
 *
 * === Setting function parameters ===
 * Each function can be controlled using a set of named parameters. The set
 * parameter command supports piggybacking of several parameters sent to the
 * current active function. Both names and values are sent in ascii.
 * The reponse will contain as many statuses as parmeters received informing
 * the host of whether the parameter was successfully set, was out of bounds
 * or did not exist at all. The notation of named parametes decouples dpsctl
 * from the OpenDPS device; you may add any functions and parameters without
 * the need for updating dpsctl.
 *
 *  HOST:   [cmd_set_parameters <param 1> \0 <value 1> \0 <param 2> \0 <value 2> ... ]
 *  DPS:    [cmd_response | cmd_set_parameters] <param 1 > <set_parameter_status_t 1> <param 2> <set_parameter_status_t 2> ...
 *
 *
 * === Listing function parameters ===
 * This command replaces the old cmd_status command and returns a list of
 * parameters associated with the current active function, their values and a
 * list of system parameters:
 *
 *   - Power out status (1/0)
 *   - Input voltage (V.VV)
 *   - Output voltage (V.VV)
 *   - Output current (A.AAA)
 *
 *  HOST:   [cmd_list_parameters]
 *  DPS:    [cmd_response | cmd_list_parameters] <param 1> \0 <value 1> \0 <param 2> \0 <value 2> ... ]
 *
 *
 * === Receiving a temperature report ===
 * This command is used by a wifi companion with the ability to measure
 * temperature. Two temperatures are included as signed 16 bit integers x10
 * and 0xffff indicates an illegal temperature. You can decide for yourself
 * if your temperature unit is Celcius, Farenheit, Kelvin or one you just made
 * up for fun.
 *
 *  HOST:   [cmd_temperature_report <temp1[15:8]> <temp1[7:0]> <temp2[15:8]> <temp2[7:0]> ]
 *  DPS:    [cmd_response | cmd_temperature_report] ]
 *
 *
 * === Setting wifi status ===
 * This command is used to set the wifi indicator on the screen. Status will be
 * one of the wifi_status_t enums
 *
 *  HOST:   [cmd_wifi_status] [<wifi_status_t>]
 *  DPS:    [cmd_response | cmd_wifi_status] [1]
 *
 *
 * === Locking the controls ===
 * This command is used to lock or unlock the controls.
 * lock = 1 will do just that
 *
 *  HOST:   [cmd_lock] [<lock>]
 *  DPS:    [cmd_response | cmd_lock] [1]
 *
 *
 * === Overcurrent protection event controls ===
 * If the DPS detects overcurrent, it will send this frame with the current
 * that caused the protection to kick in (in milliamperes).
 * The DPS does not expect a response
 *
 *  DPS:    [cmd_ocp_event] [I_cut(7:0)] [I_cut(15:8)]
 *  HOST:   none
 *
 *
 * === DPS upgrade sessions ===
 * When the cmd_upgrade_start packet is received, the device prepares for
 * an upgrade session:
 *  1. The upgrade packet chunk size is determined based on the host's request
 *     and is written into the bootcom RAM in addition with the 16 bit crc of
 *     the new firmware. and the upgrade magick.
 *  2. The device restarts.
 *  3. The booloader detecs the upgrade magic in the bootcom RAM.
 *  4. The booloader sets the upgrade flag in the PAST.
 *  5. The bootloader initializes the UART, sends the cmd_upgrade_start ack and
 *     prepares for download.
 *  6. The bootloader receives the upgrade packets, writes the data to flash
 *     and acks each packet.
 *  7. When the last packet has been received, the bootloader clears the upgrade
 *     flag in the PAST and boots the app.
 *  8. The host pings the app to check the new firmware started.
 *
 *  HOST:     [cmd_upgrade_start] [chunk_size:16] [crc:16]
 *  DPS (BL): [cmd_response | cmd_upgrade_start] [<upgrade_status_t>] [<chunk_size:16>]  [<upgrade_reason_t:8>]
 *
 * The host will send packets of the agreed chunk size with the device 
 * acknowledging each packet once crc checked and written to flash. A packet
 * smaller than the chunk size or with zero payload indicates the end of the
 * upgrade session. The device will now return the outcome of the 32 bit crc
 * check of the new firmware and continue on step 7 above.
 *
 * The upgrade data packets have the following format with the payload size
 * expected to be equal to what was aggreed upon in the cmd_upgrade_start packet.
 *
 *  HOST:   [cmd_upgrade_data] [<payload>]+
 *  DPS BL: [cmd_response | cmd_upgrade_data] [<upgrade_status_t>]
 *
